   <h3>About the Game</h3>
   <p style="margin-right: inherit;">Horizon Zero Dawn is a 2017 action game developed by Guerrilla Games and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. The storyline follows Aloy, a young hunter in a world overrun by machines, who sets out to uncover her past. The player uses many different weapons types like ranged weapons, a spear, and stealth to fight mechanical creatures and other enemy forces. The player can explore the open world to discover locations and take on side quests. It was released for the PlayStation 4 in 2017 and Microsoft Windows in 2020.</p>

   <h3>In Depth Story</h3>
   <p style="margin-right: inherit;">The story is set in a post-apocalyptic United States, between the states of Colorado, Wyoming and Utah, in the 31st century. Humans live in scattered, primitive tribes with varying levels of technological development. The world we know today is known to them as the "Old Ones". Large robotic creatures, known as "machines", dominate the Earth. Machines were created peacefully to take care of the planet. However, an event known as the "Derangement" has caused machines to become more aggressive, large, and more deadly. There are four tribes: the Nora, the Banuk, the Carja and the Oseram.</p>

   <p>Aloy is the protagonist of this adventurous rpg game. The story follows her through her life since the age of 6 years old. She grows up as an outcast from her tribe, the Nora, because they call her motherless. This may be true but she later in life learns that she was created by the AI named GAIA with the DNA from a scientist, Elizabet Sobeck, from the 21st century. A clone made for saving the planet. Aloy was raised in the wilds by a man named Rost who served as her father figure throughout her life. Throughout the storyline Aloy gains many allies, many enemies, and many who are both.</p></td>

     <h3>The Machines</h3>
     <p><i>Deathbringers, Corruptors,</i> and other FAS machines have overrun the entire planet causing the Faro Plague, including the existence of humans. An AI, <i>GAIA</i>, spread inside underground facilities around the Earth, was created by the government to manufacture its own machines to try and revive life on Earth. Each machine had an original purpose. After creating all the machines to restore life, the AI then recreated the human race.</p>

   <h4>Watcher</h4>
   <p>The Watcher are the smallest known machines, Watchers are designed for reconnaissance. The machine exists in two models: a basic model and a slightly stronger upgraded variant. Compact, inquisitive, and agile recon unit that will attempt to swarm a target in numbers.</p>

   <h4>Tallneck</h4>
    <p>This machine is absolutely harmless, except if you walk underneath it you may get stepped on. These machines are used to track locations on the map. They can be used to update large sections of your map at a time rather than having to travel and discover individual locations yourself. To obtain these maps you must climb the neck and onto the top of its head. It will then give you the option to override this machine. Overriding it will update your map.</p>

Beware that these birds will also dive down and attack. An aerial scavenger designed to keep the land clean of broken machines.</p>

As a recon machine, it patrols on a constant lookout for perceived threats.
